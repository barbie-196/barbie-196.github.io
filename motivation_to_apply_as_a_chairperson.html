            <h2>Why do I want to be a chairperson?</h2>
            <br>
            <h4>Do you remember your first session? Can you recall how nervous you were, walking towards the unknown?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>I dÎ¿, and I was terrified. But then, I met my chairperson. They were the first to help me break the ice with the delegates from my committee, the first EYP person who gave me the feeling of safety and the first person I knew I could count on during the session. This chairperson was one of my first EYP role models. </p>
            <p>Now, I belong to a huge group of alumni. I have much more experience than I had back then, but I still remember where I started. I want to be that person for some other new delegates, to be the boat captain and guide them through their first EYP experience. </p>
            <p>I will try to give the delegates all the advice I can and motivate them to become active members of EYP themselves. I want to make them enjoy the teambuilding games I will show them, as much as I did when I was a delegate myself. I am thrilled to help them with academic research during the GA and give them feedback on their points during the open debate. Encourage them to engage in fruitful conversations and support them with formulating their speeches. </p>
            <p>Just like my first chairperson did.</p>
